There are two main variations of Python for circuit boards. We have developed circuitpython and micropython variants. The circuitPython one has been designed for the [MakerPi](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-pi-rp2040) whereas the micropython libary is designed for the Pico.

# Using the library
The library contains different bots for different chassis. For memory efficiency you may want to import only the classes you want. Each class corresponds to one of the designs within [intructions and code](https://github.com/shepai/OpenEduBot/tree/main/Instructions%20and%20code). Of course, you can use your own chassis designs with these libraries. As long as you use the same hardware.
