# WheelBot
The WheelBot chassis can be implemented using a number of different dc motor controlled chassis. The one we have used was purchased from the [Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/products/adafruit-mini-3-layer-round-robot-chassis-kit-2wd-with-dc-motors). For electronics it required the following items:
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Motor driver (L298N)
- A selection of jumper wires
- One 4xAA battery holder
- One 3xAA battery holder or some form of [voltage regulator](https://thepihut.com/products/dc-dc-automatic-step-up-down-power-module-2-5-15v-to-3-3v-600ma)
- Ultrasound range finders (optional)
- IR light sensors (optional)
- Light sensitivity sensors (optional)

You should be able to build a working one of these for approx £30-£50 each depending on bulk buy and how much you are willing to solder.
