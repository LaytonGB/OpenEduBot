# WheelBot CircuitPython
The WheelBot2 chassis can be implemented using a number of different dc motor controlled chassis. The one we have used was purchased from the [Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/products/adafruit-mini-3-layer-round-robot-chassis-kit-2wd-with-dc-motors). For electronics it required the following items:
- [PiMaker](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-pi-rp2040)
- One 4xAA battery holder
- Ultrasound range finders (optional)
- IR light sensors (optional)
- Light sensitivity sensors (optional)
- AA batteries 4

## Building the chassis
Firstly you will need to get the following parts. These parts can be found in the excel spreadsheet "costs.xlsx". It approximately costs Â£50 a robot. The more you build, the cheaper they become.

### Wiring

The wiring of the motors and battery needs to be in motors 3 and 4 for the library to be compatible. You may want to strip the ends of the wires off on the motors if it cannot be directly screwed into the robotics board.
The sensor inputs can be changed to any analogue pin, if you wish to add more then they can be used.

### Step 1
Mount both of the motors on the chassis, using the side plates within the two rectangular slots on the chassis will keep the motors in place. This is the point that you can mount your chosen sensors for the lower level. If you are working with light sensors, this level is ideal.

### Step 2
Mount the main controller, make sure you have soldered some L-shaped pins underneath the Robotics board if you wish to use GPIO pins to interface with sensors. If you are using more HATs than just the robotics board, you may want to consider using Step 3 as your second layer.

### Step 3
It is ideal to have the batteries on the top, so they can be easily changed without having to unscrew the chassis.

## Programming

The physical robot makes use of sensors and two motors. We can attach a USB to it and upload the code.

## Using a different IDE
Using a specific IDEs can be simpler for using MicroPython. [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) is a simple IDE for uploading programs to the Raspberry Pi Pico. Once you have set up the IDE we can start [programming the board](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico).

### Step 1
Download the robot control library from [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shepai/OpenEduBot/main/Library/EduBot_CP.py) and have handy in a folder.

### Step 2
You will need to connect the robot to your device via USB. Make sure you have Thonny IDE up. In the bottom right corner you should be able to select the interpreter for the IDE. We want Generic CircuitPython.


## Troubleshooting
There are some problems that you may come into contact with, especially if this is your first time to electronics. We have tried to list as many here as we can. If your problem is not listed, please see [issues](https://github.com/shepai/OpenEduBot/issues) and if there still isn't an answer feel free to raise one yourself!

### The board wont connect to USB
Firstly, make sure your USB device works for data transmission. Check your wiring and make sure there is no short circuiting. If this is all fine, consider having the battery switched on while you make contact with the board. We suspect there is an issue with the current being supplied to the device and it not being seen by the PC.

### The sensors aren't working
Check your wiring, also make sure the sensors are not touching the motor pins or conducting where they should not.

### The motors are turning the wrong way
There are two ways to solve this, hardware or software. Firstly make sure that the motors are wired the same. Red Black Red Black should be the pattern going in to the device. Within the examples, you can change the motors to be of speed *-1 to reverse the motors.

```
bot.motor1_move(max(r1,20) *-1) #remove *-1 for alternate direction
bot.motor2_move(max(r2,20))
```

### The motors are not turning at allow
Make sure the motors are both the sockets. The board should be on and your code running. Solder over the outside of the motor wire tips if you can, this prevents short circuiting.

### The light detecting robot is moving away from Light
This is likely because your sensors are the wrong way round. Try changing the pins physically or switching the pins in the code.
