# Introduction

There are different chassis that the library currently supports. Of course, you can build and make your own, but these are the chassis we have built support for.

## WheelBot
Wheelbot is a robot that uses... wheels and a ball caster. It is  great for line following, obstacle avoiding, and light following tasks. This small cheap chassis can allow cheap robotics teaching in schools.

## WheelBot2
Wheelbot 2 is an updated version of wheelbot, to use a better, more compact circuit. This robot can also be cheaper than the wheelbot.
