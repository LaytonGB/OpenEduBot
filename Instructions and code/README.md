# Introduction

There are different chassis that the library currently supports. Of course, you can build and make your own, but these are the chassis we have built support for.

## [WheelBot](https://github.com/shepai/OpenEduBot/tree/main/Instructions%20and%20code/WheelBot)
Wheelbot is a robot that uses... wheels and a ball caster. It is  great for line following, obstacle avoiding, and light following tasks. This small cheap chassis can allow cheap robotics teaching in schools. This makes use of motor drivers and breadboards, allowing you to build your own circuits. This robot is better for teaching electronic tasks, and good for audience who require longer.

## [WheelBot2](https://github.com/shepai/OpenEduBot/tree/main/Instructions%20and%20code/WheelBot_2)
Wheelbot 2 is an updated version of wheelbot, to use a better, more compact circuit. This robot can also be cheaper than the wheelbot. This method requires little circuit building compared to wheelbot, making it quicker to build and deploy for any audience.

## ServoBot
Servo bot is in development, and will allow you to control two wheels via continuous rotation servos.



# CircuitPython

CircuitPython is an alternative to MicroPython that some devices use. Using EduBot_CP.py you can have access to CircuitPython variants of the chassis. These will have separate instructions.

## [WheelBot](https://github.com/shepai/OpenEduBot/tree/main/Instructions%20and%20code/CircuitPython%20WheelBot)
This is a CircuitPython variant for the wheelbot.
